## 23/01/25 | Make a thing assignment!

I've been thinking about ideas of faith, trust, and darkness this week, so that's what I decided to focus on for this first assignment.

I did admittedly have a busy week for non-school reasons, so this was a very quick thing.
I also haven't really used Bitsy for too long yet, so I wanted to start learning howw it works.

I began with the idea of a previous Twine project I made where I tried to make links that blended in with the background and took attention to see.
I then tried to apply this to a lock and key system, which seems to be a core functionality in Bitsy.
Thus I came up with the idea of progressing through rooms with progressively harder to see objects one must gather to continue

In the end, I ended up spending too long figuring out how locks worked in Bitsy, and was only able to make two rooms, not allowing for much a "difficulty curve"

Still, I do feel like I have a better idea of how the tool works! Plus, it was nice to get to write a bit and make little sprites.

## 28/01/25 | Unity Expmloration No. 1

I was watching a video on how the gravity in Super Mario Galaxy works and now I'm a bit curious about messing around wiht gravity, although I'm guessing that's something we'll look at in another week.

List of mechanics/features we looked at
- Moving with keyboard keys
- collision detection
- sprites
